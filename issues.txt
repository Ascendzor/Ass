list issues here
-----------------
1. When in "Projects" or "Entries" tables and there are no projects/entries in those tables. You cannot go back.(Up a level).
2. When clicking on "Back to list" when you have clicked on details/edit/delete, it does not know what to go back to (Null space).
3. Related to #2. When clicking on edit/details/delete then back to list. You cannot add a new project/entry without VS crashing.
